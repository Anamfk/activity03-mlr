Day 2 - Assessing a MLR Model
================

In this repository/directory you should see two items:

- `README.md` - this document.

You will continue working in your `day01-fitting/activity03.Rmd` file
that you started on [Day 1](../day01-fitting).

## Pull your changes from GitHub into RStudio

You successfully updated your GitHub repo from the main
[`README`](../README), but we still need to update your RStudio files.
Read these directions first, then work through them.

- In the **Git** pane of RStudio (upper right-hand area), locate and
  click on the
  <img src="../README-img/pull-icon.png" alt="knit" width = "20"/>
  **Pull** icon.
- After a few moments (you might need to provide your GitHub username
  and PAT), your **Files** pane will be updated with the new items.

Since you are likely looking at the `README` (this page) on GitHub,
nothing of importance for your work today was brought in. However, it is
always a good habit to **pull** from GitHub before starting to work
after taking a break. For example, if you were collaborating on a
project with others, they might do work at different times than you (or
even at the same time). It is always good to solve problems on your end
before **push**ing to GitHub and causing more problems.

Now, continue working on your `activity03.Rmd` document that you began
in Day 1.

## What is next?

We will explore interaction terms (Section 3.3.2) and ways to work
around problems that arise in linear regression models (Section 3.3.3)
while answering the important modeling questions (Section 3.2.2).
